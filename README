== Overview ==

This is a toolkit named after my girl. It aims to provide high performance ActionScript 3 image loading and processing tools, such as pooled loader background loading and so on.

It also will provide a Image zooming component which I use now.

Needless to say, flex Image Object is lame, very lame. It needs somebody do something to get it better.

Hope my work will at least do something useful to the flex programming community.
